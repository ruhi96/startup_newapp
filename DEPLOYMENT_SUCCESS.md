### Commits in Repository
1. `Initial commit: Android News Case Study App with secure API key handling` - Full app code
2. `Update README with API key setup instructions` - Documentation update

## How to Use

### For You (Original Developer)
Your OpenAI API key is saved locally in:
- `C:\Users\91956\AndroidNewsApp\local_api_keys.xml`

This file is **NOT** pushed to GitHub (it's in `.gitignore`), so your key remains private.

**To run the app:**
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open the project from `C:\Users\91956\AndroidNewsApp`
3. The app will automatically use your API key from `local_api_keys.xml`
4. Click Run!

### For Other Developers (Cloning Your Repo)
Anyone who clones your repository will need to:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ruhi96/startup_newapp.git`
2. Follow instructions in [API_KEY_SETUP.md](API_KEY_SETUP.md)
3. Add their own OpenAI API key
4. Run the app

## Files Pushed to GitHub

### Source Code

### NOT Pushed (Protected)
- ❌ local_api_keys.xml (your actual API key)
- ❌ .gradle folder
- ❌ build folders
- ❌ .idea folder
- ❌ local.properties

## Security Notes

### ✅ What Was Fixed
1. **Removed API key from code** - No longer hardcoded in OpenAIService.java
2. **Cleaned git history** - Completely removed old commits containing the key
3. **Added configuration system** - API keys now loaded from external files
4. **Protected sensitive files** - Added to .gitignore

### 🔐 How API Key is Now Handled
```java
// Old (INSECURE - was in previous commits):
private static final String API_KEY = "sk-proj-..."; // ❌ Hardcoded

// New (SECURE - current code):
private static String API_KEY = null; // ✅ Loaded from config
initApiKey(context); // Reads from local_api_keys.xml or api_keys.xml
```

### 📝 Best Practices Implemented
- ✅ API keys in separate config files
- ✅ Config files added to .gitignore
- ✅ Template file for other developers
- ✅ Clear documentation on setup
- ✅ Clean git history (no leaked secrets)
