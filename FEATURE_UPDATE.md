3. Generate case study from that single article
```

### After (NEW Behavior):
```
1. Fetch news from ALL 5 sources
2. Collect up to 5 most recent articles
3. Send ALL articles to OpenAI
4. AI analyzes if articles are about the same/related topics
5. If related → Combines them into ONE comprehensive case study
6. If different → Focuses on the most newsworthy story
7. Displays ONE comprehensive case study with multiple sources cited
```
